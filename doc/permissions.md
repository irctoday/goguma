# Permissions

On Android, Goguma requests the following permissions:

- `INTERNET`: to connect to IRC servers.
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`: to reconnect to IRC servers when becoming online.
- `WAKE_LOCK`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`:
  to keep running in the background when the server doesn't support the IRC
  chathistory extension ([flutter_background]).
- `VIBRATE`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: to show notifications
  ([flutter_local_notifications]).
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: to share the current location.
