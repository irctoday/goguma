# goguma

An IRC client for mobile devices.

Goals:

- Modern: support for many IRCv3 extensions, plus some special support for IRC
  bouncers.
- Easy to use: offer a simple, straightforward interface.
- Offline-first: users should be able to read past conversations while offline,
  and network disruptions should be handled transparently
- Lightweight: go easy on resource usage to run smoothly on older phones and
  save battery power.
- Cross-platform: the main target platforms are Linux and Android.
