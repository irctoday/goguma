# [goguma]

[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~emersion/goguma/commits/master.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~emersion/goguma/commits/master?)

An IRC client for mobile devices.

Goals:

- Modern: support for many IRCv3 extensions, plus some special support for IRC
  bouncers.
- Easy to use: offer a simple, straightforward interface.
- Offline-first: users should be able to read past conversations while offline,
  and network disruptions should be handled transparently
- Lightweight: go easy on resource usage to run smoothly on older phones and
  save battery power.
- Cross-platform: the main target platforms are Linux and Android.

If you want to try out goguma on Android, you can use our
[F-Droid repository][fdroid-nightly] which provides nightly builds.
Alternatively, you can grab APKs directly from [our CI][android-ci] (check out
build artifacts).
